This is ment to be a very basic minecraft chat bot verification system with hardcoded commands for beginners. Go ahead and do what you want with it.

How To Run
1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download repository
3. Extract the files to your directory of choice
4. Open a terminal
5. Navigate to the current directory (if you havent already)
6. Run 'npm i minecraft-protocol'
7. Once that has finished update the values in the code that need to be changed (port, ip, botname, etc)
8. Run 'node index.js' in the terminal to start your script

Note
I recomend downloading some sort of IDE. I use VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

If you change the name of the main file, in this case index.js, then you need to adjust the command to be 'node updatedFileName.js' to start it
